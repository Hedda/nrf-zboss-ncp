You can choose between using the UART or the USB port on the nRF5340 DK

- If you are using UART (v2.6.0_ncp_zboss_max_mem_nrf5340_uart.hex), the connection is going through the onboard interface MCU. You'll have to connect from the SEGGER J-Link
USB connector

- If you are using USB (v2.6.0_ncp_zboss_max_mem_nrf5340_usb.hex), the connection is going through the nRF USB connector.
